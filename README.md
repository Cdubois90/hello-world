This is the first repository that I am making/learning with. 

Hello everyone!

I'm new here learning how to program using R.  I found out I'm starting to enjoy data analysis after a few projects that I've worked on using excel and I want to take it one step farther.  
If all goes well, I'm hoping to use those projects I'm already familiar with in excel and see how much I can play around with data.  
Here's to hoping!
